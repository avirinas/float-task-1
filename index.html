                <p>Sir Isaac Newton PRS was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer,
                alchemist, theologian, and author (described in his time as a "natural philosopher") widely recognised as one of the
                greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the most influential scientists. He was a key figure in the
                philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical
                Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal
                contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing
                infinitesimal calculus. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" class="">Read more...</a></p>

            <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all
            time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the
            development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern
            physics.His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the
            world's most famous equation". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" class="">Read more...</a>

            <p>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist
            best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.
            
            Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree,
            gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power
            industry. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" class="">Read more...</a></p><br>
